`ggwaffle` works to help easily create waffle charts with `ggplot2` style syntax. ggwaffle is designed to work in a very similar way to the original [waffle package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle), while being slightly closer to the workflow of a standard ggplot graphic. Consequently, it is a little more verbose.

The goal of `lambdapply` is to enable R users to scale their R code using [AWS Lambda serverless compute service](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), with a familiar *apply syntax.
